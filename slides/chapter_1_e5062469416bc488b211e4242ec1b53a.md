## What is Partitioning

```yaml

**What is Partitioning?**
- _Partitioning is splitting one (parent) table into smaller (children) tables._

**You will Learn the basics of partitioning
**
- Why
- Where
- How


`@script`
Partitioning is the splitting of a table into smaller, children, tables.

In this course, you will learn about why partitioning is used, on which type of tables will you find it, and how to use it to optimize your queries.

## Why Use Partitioning

```yaml

**Why DBAs Use Partitions** {{1}}
- Improve bulk load and delete performance {{1}}
- Grants storage flexibility {{1}}

**Why Analysts Use Partitions**{{1}}
- Query Performance {{1}}

**When are they Used?** {{2}}
- Large Tables {{2}}
- Commonly used filtering columns {{2}}


`@script`
Database Administrators may opt to utilize partitions for a variety of reasons.
- For instance, adding or deleting a partition can speed bulk loads and deletes that would otherwise operate on an entire table.
- Children tables can be stored on different servers and seldom used partitions can be moved to cheaper, slower storage options.
 
Analysts and data scientists can then utilize these partitions to improve query performance. Referencing a partition allows the query to search a subset of data,speeding performance.

It is important to note partitioning requires resources so is not used on every table. Large tables with a common filter condition, such as a date or location column, provide good use cases.
