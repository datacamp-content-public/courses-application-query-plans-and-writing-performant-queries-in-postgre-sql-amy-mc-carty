We just learned about different database storage methods. Now let's now dive into some of the optimization techniques used with row storage, starting with partitions.

## What is Partitioning

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "db456a42e5"
```

`@part1`
**What is Partitioning?**
- _Partitioning is splitting one (parent) table into smaller (children) tables._

**You will Learn the basics of Partitioning
**
- Why
- Where
- How


`@script`
Partitioning is the splitting of a table into smaller, children, tables.

In this course, you will learn about why partitioning is used, on which type of tables will you find it, and how to use it to optimize your queries.

## Why and Where to Use Partitioning

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7f208bf25e"
```

`@part1`
**Why DBAs Use Partitions** {{1}}
- Improve bulk load and delete performance {{1}}
- Grants storage flexibility {{1}}

**Why Analysts Use Partitions**{{1}}
- Query Performance {{1}}

**Where is Partitioning Used?** {{2}}
- Large Tables {{2}}
- Commonly used filtering columns {{2}}


`@script`
Database Administrators may opt to utilize partitions for a variety of reasons.
- For instance, adding or deleting a partition can speed bulk loads and deletes that would otherwise operate on an entire table.
- Children tables can be stored on different servers and seldom used partitions can be moved to cheaper, slower storage options.
 
Analysts and data scientists can then utilize these partitions to improve query performance. Referencing a partition allows the query to search a subset of data,speeding performance.

It is important to note partitioning requires resources so is not used on every table. Large tables with a common filter condition, such as a date or location column, provide good use cases.

## Referencing Partitions in a Query

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "846a4eda1c"
```

`@part1`
**Date Partition** {{1}}
```sql
select customer_id
, order_id
, order_date
, product_quantity
from customer_orders
where order_date > ‘2018-01-01’ 
``` {{1}}

**Location Partition** {{2}}
```sql
select o.customer_id
, o.order_id
, o.order_date
, o.product_quantity
from customer_orders o
left outer join customer_info i 
   on o.customer_id = i.id
   and i.billing_statecode = 2
where o.order_date > ‘2018-01-01’ 

``` {{2}}


`@script`
Let's use some transaction orders data to see how to add partitions to some sample queries.
 
Partitions are very commonly built on date fields that are then referenced in a query's where condition. This first example shows a customer orders table that is split into partitioned table based on the order_date. Because the query references order_date in the where clause, only the child table or tables with order dates greater than January 2018 will be searched.

A location field is another good candidate for a partition, and this second example uses billing state as the partitioned column in the customer info table. The billing state is referenced in the join condition, demonstrating the second method of utilizing partitions in a query. So this examples uses the order date partition from the customer orders table to only search the partitions with dates greater than January 2018. In addition, it uses the billing statecode partition from the customer info table, allowing the query to search only the partitions with a statecode of 2.

Now it's your turn to practice what you have learned by using partitions and I will see you back here soon.
